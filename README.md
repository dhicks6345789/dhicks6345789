Hello, I'm David Hicks. I'm a software developer working in the education sector in the UK - I work part-time at a private prep school in central London, where I deal with the day-to-day IT requirements (desktop machines, laptops, networking, on-site server provision), with the rest of my time spent working on my own software and services.

I'm interested in reducing the administrative burden to schools of using IT resources, both in the classroom and at the back-end. User and identity management should be things that, ideally, just disapear into the background in the classroom, with the focus being on whatever subject is actually being taught.

I work mostly in Python, with front-end work using HTML, Javascript and Bootstrap. I've more recently been using Go, as it better suits some applications. I have some experience with the Gov.UK Design System, having used their front-end template, and with static site generation tools such as Hugo, Eleventy and Jekyll.

Some of my projects here are related to making it easier for developers working in, and writing applications for, school and enterprise markets to make their applications deployable and usable by the average user, so I'd be interested in hearing from anyone wanting to use my software in their workplace.

You can find me at [my own website](https://www.sansay.co.uk), or over on [Edugeek](https://www.edugeek.net).
